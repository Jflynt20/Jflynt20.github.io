        <p>The Simpson County Academy high school basketball team was hosting the 4A state tournament. In which they were playing against the Copiah colonels for the state title.  .</p>
        <p>Led by 6 seniors, 2 juniors,and a sophmore point guard, the cougars jumped to an early lead. Although early foul trouble kept the cougars from being able to pull away throughout the game. They still managed o secure their lead in the second half with great free throw shooting from their players. The Colonels could never get within striking distance. This win meant a lot for the school and the team, but the coolest part was this was their coaches overall 1000th win as a high school basketball coach so it made the night that much better. </p>
